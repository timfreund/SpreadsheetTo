SpreadsheetTo is a python library and command line utility for turning
spreadsheets into text and programmer friendly formats.

It supports xls and xlsx on the input side, and CSV on the output
side, with more to come on the output side.

This library began because so many open data projects seem to start by
parsing Excel spreadsheets into something else, and all of my projects
had an ad hoc implementation of that using a library that only worked
with one version of Excel documents.

This library only supports Excel for now because I haven't yet seen
any other spreadsheet formats while browsing data.gov for interesting
datasets.  That can always change, though.
